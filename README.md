# Philadelphia Licenses and Inspections Appeals Decision Results

This research will be based on the statistical data provided by OpenDataPhilly portal in the L&I Appeals dataset.

My goal is to create the best possible model to accurately predict the appeal decision. This prediction model can help Philadelphia homeowners filing appeals with the L&I board. The model will show which variables can positively or negatively affect the L&I appeal decision.
